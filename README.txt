Welcome to this project.

This project aims to use videos (such as films, TV shows, YouTube, the news, etc) and audios (such as podcasts, music, conversaations, etc) to help you (most importantly) reinforce your understanding of currently only Spanish, but also learn new words.

This is written in Python and is a side project so please don't complain too much as there aare a few small issues.

Setup 
You will need to install all of the dependecies etc. 
Setup two seperate folders. - Audio, here you will need a .mp3 and a .essub.txt file to contain the spanish transcript. Video, here you will need a .es.srt file and a .mp4 at the moment.

A video will be created real soon to help explain this.
